extensions.datacookbook_search@idatainc.com.description=Search your Data Cookbook while you browse.  This extension was developed to enable people to find definitions and report specifications by simply selecting some text, right-clicking and choosing one of the search options.  The results show in a sidebar that can later be hidden when no longer needed.
